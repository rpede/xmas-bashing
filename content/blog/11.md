title:  Select from the menu

When creating interactive scripts, it is commonly needed to provide a way for
users to select an option from a menu.
It can be accomplished with the `read` command and a `case` statement, but
there is a smarter way.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PS3="What is your favorite programming language? "

select language in Bash Java C# Python; do
  echo "You choose $language"
done
```

The `PS3` variable is used to set the prompt for the `select` statement.

Try it out!

It keeps prompting forever.
We can break out with the `break` keyword.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PS3="What is your favorite programming language? "

select language in Bash Java C# Python; do
  echo "You choose $language"
  break
done
```

If you want different actions to take place depending on the selected option
then you can combine with a `case` statement.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PS3="What is your favorite programming language? "

select language in Bash Java C# Python; do
  case $language in
  "Bash")
    echo "$language and crash :(){ :|:& };:"
    ;;
  "Java")
    echo "You like strong coffe, because you are all about that $language GUI"
    ;;
  "C#")
    echo "You wear glasses so you can $language"
    ;;
  "Python")
    echo "$language because you can't keep anything private"
    ;;
  esac
done
```

Or if you only want to prompt once.


```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PS3="What is your favorite programming language? "

select language in Bash Java C# Python quit; do
  break
done

case $language in
"Bash")
  echo "$language and crash :(){ :|:& };:"
  ;;
"Java")
  echo "You like strong coffe, because you are all about that $language GUI"
  ;;
"C#")
  echo "You wear glasses so you can $language"
  ;;
"Python")
  echo "$language because you can't keep anything private"
  ;;
"quit")
  echo "Done."
  break
  ;;
esac
```

You can also have user select an option from an array.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

options=(Bash Java C# Python)

select option in "${options[@]}"; do
  echo "You selected $option"
done
```

It also means that you can let the user pick from the output of a command.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PS3="Please select a folder in your home directory: "

IFS=$'\n'
options=($(ls -1 -d ~))

select option in "${options[@]}"; do
  echo "You selected $option"
done
```

It uses `-1` flag for `ls` command to output one item per line.

By default bash split items on any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
We can change this behavior by setting the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator)
variable.
We are setting it to newline, because we got one item per line.
