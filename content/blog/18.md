The `sed` (stream editor) command combines search and transform in one command.
You can match patterns in text using
[RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) like `grep`.
But instead of highlighting matches, it is used to transform matches.

Create a file for demonstration:

```
cat > unix-philosophy.txt << EOF
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
EOF
```

Use `sed` to change the text.

```sh
cat unix-philosophy.txt | sed 's/Write/Vibe code/'
```

_It's a joke_

Or we can let `sed` read the file directly.

```sh
sed 's/Write/Vibe code/' unix-philosophy.txt
```

Output to a file.

```sh
sed 's/Write/Vibe code/' unix-philosophy.txt > mcp-manifest.txt
```

Or change the file directly.

```sh
sed -i 's/text/json/' mcp-manifest.txt
```

We can make it quite when a match is found.

```sh
sed '/work/q' unix-philosophy.txt
```

Delete a word.

```sh
sed 's/well//' mcp-manifest.txt
```

Or delete a line.

```sh
sed '/well/d' mcp-manifest.txt
```

Some transforms can be combined.

```sh
sed 's/Write/Vibe code/ ; /well/d' unix-philosophy.txt
```

Text can be appended.

```sh
sed 'aIt''s a joke' mcp-manifest.txt
```
