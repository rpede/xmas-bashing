Looking for a file or directory?
The `find` command is what you need.

This is one of those rare occasions where a command doesn't have a slightly
cryptic name.

`find` can be used to find files or directories.

Say you want to find all PDF documents in your home directory.

```sh
find ~ -name '*.pdf'
```

The `~` (tilde) is a shortcut for your home directory.
We tell it to search for a name with `-name` matching pattern the pattern
enclosed in single-quotes.
The `*` matches any number of characters, so effectively we are matching
anything that ends with '.pdf'.

Note that it searches in all sub-directories of the given path by default.

We can use `-iname` for a case-insensitive match.

```sh
find ~ -iname '*.pdf'
```

`find` can also match on other attributes that name.

We can look for all files in any sub-directories that have been modified within
a day (24h).

```sh
find . -type f -mtime 0
```

Or within a week:

```sh
find . -type f -mtime 7
```

The `-type f` flag means to only match files.
You can also do `-type d` instead for directories.

To look for large files in your "Download" directory, do:

```sh
find ~/Downloads -type f -size +100M
```

It is also possible to execute other commands on the matches.

```sh
find . -name '*.md' -type f -exec wc -m "{}" \;
```

It counts characters (using `wc -m`) on markdown files.
Where `{}` is placeholder for file path and `\;` signals end of parameters.
It invokes `wc` for each entry.

We can also have it invoke `wc` just once with all file paths as parameters
with:

```sh
find . -name '*.md' -type f -exec wc -m "{}" \+
```

Notice it ends with `\+`.
