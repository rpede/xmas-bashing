No, it is not about the `wc` command.

[toilet](https://github.com/cacalabs/toilet) is a CLI tool that turns text into
[ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art).
It simply means using text characters to draw graphics.
Why?
Because it is fun.

You could use `toilet` to add an ASCII art banner to fancy up your script.

## Install

Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S toilet
```

Ubuntu/Debian:

```sh
sudo apt install toilet
```

If `toilet` isn't found in your package manager, then you could try with [figlet](https://www.figlet.org/) instead.

## Usage

To ASCIIfy a string:

```sh
toilet "Hello World"
```

Example output:

![Sample toilet output](/xmas-bashing/toilet-hello-world.png)

Same, but from stdin:

```sh
echo "Hello World" | toilet
```

Using a color filter:

```sh
toilet --metal "Hello World"
```

With a different font:

```sh
toilet -f emboss "Hello World"
```

See what font options are available

```sh
ls /user/share/figlet
```

# Challenge

Use what you learned so far to write a script that prints the lyrics to "The
Twelve Days of Christmas" with either `toilet` or `figlet`.
