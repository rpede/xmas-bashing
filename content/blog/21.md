title: Drowning in notifications
date: 2025-12-21

Most desktop environments (KDE, GNOME, Xfce etc) support notifications.
Implementations are based on [Desktop Notifications
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification/latest-single/).

If you are using a stand-alone window manager (like Hyprland or Sway) instead
of a desktop environment, you can still use notifications.
You just need a notification daemon such as
[Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/showcase/),
[Fnott](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fnott),
[SwayNotificationCenter](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter)
etc.
You might already have one installed and running.

automation tasks.
It could be: backing up files with [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) or
[scp](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html), transcoding media
with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), or bulk resizing images with
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).

## Install

To send notifications from a script, you need the libnotify package.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```sh
sudo apt install libnotify-bin
```

**Arch Linux**

```sh
sudo pacman -Sy libnotify
```

## Usage

### Simple

To send a notification, all you have to do is run `notify-send`.

```sh
notify-send "Hello World"
```

Exactly what the notification looks like depend on desktop environment or
notification daemon.
I run GNOME, so for me, it looks like this.

### Body

Notifications can also have a body.

```sh
notify-send "Hello World" "Please be aware that a notification has been send"
```

### Markup

A limited set of HTML style markup can be used.

```sh
notify-send "hello world" '<b>please</b> be <i>aware</i> that a <u>notification</u> has been send'
```

| Tag | Description |
|-|-|
| `<b></b>` | <b>Bold</b> |
| `<i></i>` | <i>Italic</i> |
| `<u></u>` | <u>Underline</u> |
| `<a href="..."></a>` | <a href="#">Link</a> |
| `<img src="..."/>` | Image <img src="/xmas-bashing/favicon.ico" /> |

### Urgency

You can also set the urgency of a notification.

```sh
notify-send -u critical "Important" "Something critically important"
```

It might not immediately look any different from a normal notification.
But setting urgency can alter the behavior.
For instance, a critical notification is always shown in GNOME, even when "Do
Not Disturb" is on.

### Icon

An icon can be set.

```sh
notify-send -u critical -i /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/symbolic/status/weather-storm-symbolic.svg "Weather warning" "a storm is comming"
```

### Other

Check out the man page for other options.

```sh
man notify-send
```

Note that not all options are implemented in all notification daemons.
