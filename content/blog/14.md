title: Keep your zenity

Zenity is much like the `dialog` package from the day before, except it shows
dialog as GUI.
[WineTricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks) is an example of a
package that uses zenity.

We are stepping a bit away from pure bash here.
This should only be used for scripts intended for desktop users.

**Info**

To make a simple dialog that just showing some information.

```sh
zenity --info --title="Hello" --text="Hello World"
```

**Form**

You can also create a dialog with a form.

```sh
zenity --forms --title="Login" --text="Credentials" --add-entry="Username" --add-password="Password"
```

**File**

A file chooser.

```sh
zenity --file-selection
```

**Directory**

Or pick a directory.

```sh
zenity --file-selection --directory
```

**Other**

To see a fill list of dialog types:

```sh
zenity --help-all
```

Zenity is based on GTK so it integrates nicely into GNOME desktop environment.
If you use KDE then you might take a look at
[kdialog](https://develop.kde.org/docs/administration/kdialog/) instead.
