Previously we have looked at various ways of making scripts interactive with
`read` and `select`.
You can use the `dialog` package if you want something a bit fancier.

It allows you to create various dialog boxes from your scripts.

## Installation

Ubuntu / Debian

```sh
sudo apt install dialog
```

Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S dialog
```

## Usage

To show a **simple message**:

```sh
dialog --msgbox "Hello World" 6 20
```

Where `6` and `20` is the height and width of the dialog.

A title can also be set.

```sh
dialog --title "Lorem Ipsum" \
  --msgbox "Incidunt ut ullam laudantium. Illum enim accusantium fugit ipsa. Molestiae quia quia sit eaque ut harum. Nemo sunt et cum error doloremque animi aut consequatur." \
  10 40
```

Notice `\` is used escape newline char, so the command can span several lines.

Some of the text is still visible after the dialog has been closed.
This can be fixed with the `--clear` flag.

```sh
dialog --title "Lorem Ipsum" --clear \
  --msgbox "Incidunt ut ullam laudantium. Illum enim accusantium fugit ipsa. Molestiae quia quia sit eaque ut harum. Nemo sunt et cum error doloremque animi aut consequatur." \
  10 40
```

**Input**

We can also make dialog boxes that allows the user to type input.

```sh
dialog --title "Name" --clear --inputbox "Please enter your name:" 10 40
```

You might be wondering, how you can reference the text that was types into an
inputbox.
It simply goes to `stderr` so you can redirect it to a file.

```sh
dialog --title "Name" --clear --inputbox "Please enter your name:" 10 40 2> name
```

Now you got a file named "name" with whatever the user typed.
Notice `2>` means redirect `stderr`.

If you don't want to use any intermediate files, then we can pass `--stdout`
flag.

```sh
name=`dialog --stdout --title "Name" --clear --inputbox "Please enter your name:" 10 40`
```

**Yes/No**

Great for confirming an action before proceeding.

```sh
dialog --title "Proceed" --clear --yesno "Do you really want to proceed?" 10 40
```

Check the exit code for answer (`echo $?`) where `0` is "yes" and `1` is "no".

## Other types of boxes

**Password**

The package supports many different kinds of dialogs.
Let's look at some.

```sh
dialog --title "Password" --insecure --clear --passwordbox "Please enter your password for sudo:" 10 40
```

Or with stars `*`:

```sh
dialog --title "Password" --insecure --clear --passwordbox "Please enter your password for sudo:" 10 40
```

**Menu**

```sh
dialog --clear --title "You favorite distro" "$@" \
        --menu "What is your favorite Linux distribution?\n\n\
          Choose the distro you like:" 20 50 4 \
        "Ubuntu"  "Very popular" \
        "Mint" "Often recommended to beginners" \
        "Bazzite" "Great for gaming" \
        "Arch Linux" "Simple and customizable" \
        "NixOS" "Unified configuration"
```

**Checklist**

```sh
dialog --title "Which are fruits?" "$@" \
        --checklist "HR have asked you to identify objects.\n\
Your answer might be used to replace humans with AI.\n\
Press SPACE to toggle an option on/off. \n\n\
  Which of the following are fruits?" 20 61 5 \
        "Apple"  "It's an apple." off \
        "Dog"    "No, that's not my dog." ON \
        "Orange" "Yeah, that's juicy." off \
        "Chicken"    "Normally not a pet." off \
        "Cat"    "No, never put a dog and a cat together!" oN \
        "Fish"   "Cats like fish." On \
        "Lemon"  "You know how it tastes." on 
```

**Calendar**

```sh
dialog --title "Christmas" --clear --calendar "Please choose a date..." 0 0 24 12 2025
```

**File select**

```sh
dialog --title "Please choose a file" "$@" --fselect "$HOME/" 14 48
```
