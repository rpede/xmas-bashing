Sometimes you have scripts with some repetition.
To avoid copy-pasting you can write loops.
Bash has a couple of different ways of writing loops.

First, I'll show a brief example of each, then I'll show a couple of more
interesting use-cases.

**for-loop**

```sh
for ((i = 1; i < 10; i++)); do
  echo $i
done
```

**for-in (aka for-each)**

```sh
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo $i
done
```

or

```sh
for i in "foo" "bar" "baz"; do
  echo $i
done
```

**while-loop**

```sh
i=1
while [ $i -le 10 ]; do
  echo $i
  ((i++))
done
```

**until-loop*L

```sh
until [ $i -gt 10 ]; do
  echo $i
  ((i++))
done
```

# Challenge

Write a script that draws a Christmas tree out of `*` using a loop.
Example:

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
   *
```
