title: "Having an argument"

We can pass arguments to scripts.
Create a file name `hello.sh` in your favorite text-editor (beginners often use
[nano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2PU--TctAM)).

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello $1"
```

Make it executable and let's run it with an argument.

```sh
./hello.sh Bob
```

We can use multiple arguments.
Change the echo line to:

```sh
echo "Hello $1 and $2"
```

Then do:

```sh
./hello.sh Alice Bob
```

As you probably guessed, we can have as many arguments as we want.

There are a couple of special variables as well that are related to arguments.

- `$0` is the name of the script itself.
- `$#` is the number of arguments.
- `$@` contains all the arguments.

Try to modify the echo to:

```sh
echo "Hello from $0 to you all $# ($@)"
```

Then test it with:

```sh
./hello.sh Alice Bob Charlie
```
