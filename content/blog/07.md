A function is a set of commands with a name.
They are useful when the same series of commands needs to run multiple places
in your script.
And can also be used to provide a better structure for your scripts.

There are two ways to specify a function:

```
function function_name() {
  commands
}
```

Or

```
function_name() {
  commands
}
```

Arguments works the same way they do for scripts see [Dec 2](02) for details.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
greeting="Hello"

function hello() {
  local name=$1
  echo "$greeting $name"
}

hello Bob
```

Variables are global by default.
To declare a variable that only exists inside the function you can use the
`local` keyword.

Beware that a functions must be defined (earlier in the script) before it can
be invoked.

You can specify an "exit-code" for the function by ending it with a `return`
statement.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
function meaning() {
  return 42
}
meaning
echo "Function exit code: $?"
```

If you want your function to output some text then you can use the `echo`
command and assign the output of a function to a variable.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
greeting="Hello"

function hello() {
  local name=$1
  echo "$greeting $name"
}

output=$(hello Bob)
echo "Output from function: $output"
```
