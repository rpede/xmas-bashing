It's time to [kick ass and chew gum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1TcnQxV4BE).

[Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) by [charm_](https://charm.land/) is
a set of utilities for making "glamorous" shell scripts.

## Install

**Arch Linux**

```sh
pacman -Sy gum
```

**Other Linux**

If you can't find it in your distributions package manager, then try installing
it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install gum
```

_Works on macOS too._

## Usage

Gum contains utilities for different tasks.
They are mostly centered around interactivity in CLI.

### Pager

A pager allows you to scroll around in a large amount of text.

```sh
lshw | gum pager
```

It can be used as an alternative to `more` or `less` commands.

### Choose

Choose from a menu of options (alternative to [select](../11)).

```sh
echo "What do you want to do?"
gum choose "backup" "update" "install" "reset" "test"
```

### Input

You can prompt for input.

```sh
echo "Create admin user"
gum input --placeholder "username"
```

### Confirm

You can also use it to show a confirmation dialog.

```sh
gum confirm "Confirm changes?" 
```

### File picker

Let user pick a file.

```sh
gum file ~
```

### Other

Gum can also server other utility functions.
