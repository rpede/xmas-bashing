title: Something if-fi
date: 2025-12-04

We need ways to branch the execution in our scripts.
Maybe we want to check that certain conditions are met before executing the
command.
A simple way to to this is with the if-then syntax.

```
if [ condition ]; then
  # execute something
fi
# continue here
```

Read as: if condition is met then execute something.

Say we have a script that requires two arguments
Then we can bail out with a helpful error message if not exactly two are given.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "$#" -ne 2 ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <username> <password>"
    exit 1
fi
# Continue with login
```

Here the script will exit with a helpful error message if not exactly two
arguments are given.
The `-ne` part means not equal.
There is also `-eq` for equal, `-gt` for greater-than and `-lt` for less-than.
You can compare strings with `==` for equal, `!=` for not-equal.
You can even make conditions based on [regular
expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) with `=~`.
See
[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Conditional-Constructs.html#index-_005b_005b)
for more details.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't write or use scripts that accepts a password as argument like this,
> since it will end up in your command history (`.bash_history` file).

A safe way of accepting password input is:

```sh
read -s -p "Password: " password
```

Then access it through the `$password` variable.

**If..elif..Else statement**

We can use `elif` to specify alternative conditions.
And `else` for commands to run if neither conditions match.
Hers is an example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "$#" -eq 1 ]]; then
  read -s -p "Password: " password
elif [[ "$#" -eq 2 ]]; then
  username=$1
  password=$2
else
  echo "Usage: $0 <username>"
  exit 1
fi
echo "Login..."
```

**Exit codes**

Also and interesting thing to note with `exit 1` that we exit with a exit-code
of `1`.
Exit codes are used for error handling.
All values except `0` is considered an error.
If you just type `[[ 1 -ne 1 ]]` directly in bash, you get an exit code of `1`,
signaling that the conditions isn't true.
You can check the last exit code with `echo $?` .

**Challenge**

Create a script that checks if it is Christmas-eve.

_Hint: use `man date`_
