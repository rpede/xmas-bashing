A `case` statement is another form of branching.
It is a great alternative to `if..elif` when you have many conditions, such as
if you want to specify sub-commands.
You specify an expression (typically a variable) to match on, then one or more
patterns.
The statements for a pattern is executed if it matches the expression.
A pattern and associated statements is called a clause and must be terminated
with `;;`.

```
case EXPRESSION in

  PATTERN_1)
    STATEMENTS
    ;;
  PATTERN_2)
    STATEMENTS
    ;;
  *)
    STATEMENTS
    ;;
esac
```

Here is an example of how it could be used in a script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
subcommand=$1
case $subcommand in
  start)
    echo "Starting service"
    ;;
  stop | kill)
    echo "Stopping service"
    ;;
  status)
    echo "Service is running"
    ;;
  *)
  echo "Unknow sub-command $1"
  ;;
esac
```

This `case` statement in bash is similar to the `switch` statement in many
programming language, except it automatically breaks on a matching statement.

If we have multiple patterns for which we want to execute the same set of
commands, then we can use `|` to specify multiple patterns for the same clause.

The `*` pattern matches everything.
Therefore, it is often used to specify a default clause for when none of the
other patterns match the expression.

There are other special characters that can be used.
